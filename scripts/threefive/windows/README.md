# Setting up Neo4j Enterprise Edition - Windows

**Disclaimer**: This document is aimed at getting a Neo4j database up-and-running in the context of a training or experiment. It is **not** fit for production installation purposes. It also assumes a single user developer installation and is in that respect similar to a Neo4j Desktop installation (which also provides the Enterprise Edition). For that purpose the Neo4j Enterprise Edition software requires no further licensing. For any other purpose â€¦ **it does** !
